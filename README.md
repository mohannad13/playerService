# playerService
This project is a RESTful service built with Spring Boot. It provides a service to serve player data from a CSV file through two endpoints:

GET /api/players: Returns the list of all players.
GET /api/players/{playerID}: Returns a single player by their ID

Future Enhancements

This project was developed within a limited time frame of 3 hours, which guided the scope and the current feature set. With additional time, the following improvements and features are considered for future development:

Database Integration
Migrate Data Storage: Transition from storing player data in a CSV file to using a relational database, which would enhance data integrity, allow for more complex queries, and provide better performance.
Caching
Implement Caching: Introduce caching mechanisms to improve response times for frequently requested data, reducing the load on the database and enhancing the overall user experience.
Code Refinement
Code Quality: Refactor the existing codebase to enhance readability, maintainability, and adherence to SOLID principles and clean code standards.
Logging
Robust Logging: Implement a comprehensive logging strategy to capture detailed information about the application's operational events, aiding in monitoring and troubleshooting.
Containerization
Containerize Application: Package the application in containers using Docker, which will simplify deployment and scaling in various environments.
Testing
Enhanced Testing: Extend the test suite to include integration and end-to-end tests, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the application.
Authentication and Security
Secure API Access: Implement an authentication mechanism to restrict access to the player data, ensuring that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations.
